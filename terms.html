    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>By using Goke Motor Services ("we," "us," or "our") and engaging our car buying service, you agree to the following terms and conditions.</p>

    <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
    <p>Goke Motor Services is a licensed car buying service that sources vehicles from dealer-only auctions on behalf of customers. We charge a flat service fee based on the vehicle price range, in addition to the wholesale auction price of the vehicle.</p>

    <h2>2. Service Fee</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Vehicles $3,000 &amp; under: <strong>$500</strong> service fee</li>
      <li>Vehicles $3,001 – $10,000: <strong>$750</strong> service fee</li>
      <li>Vehicles $10,001 &amp; up: <strong>$1,000</strong> service fee</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The service fee is paid upfront before we begin sourcing your vehicle. This fee covers auction access, vehicle inspection, paperwork handling, and dedicated support throughout the process.</p>

    <h2>3. Refund Guarantee</h2>
    <p>We offer a <strong>100% refund of the service fee</strong> under the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are unable to find a vehicle that meets your specified criteria within a reasonable timeframe</li>
      <li>The deal falls through due to circumstances beyond your control</li>
      <li>You are unsatisfied with the options presented and no vehicle has been purchased on your behalf</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The service fee is <strong>non-refundable</strong> once a vehicle has been purchased at auction with your approval. Once you approve a bid and the vehicle is won, the transaction is considered final.</p>

    <h2>4. Vehicle Purchases</h2>
    <p>All vehicles are purchased from dealer-only auctions. The auction price is the price you pay for the vehicle (plus applicable taxes, title, and registration fees). We do not add dealer markup or doc fees beyond our stated service fee.</p>

    <h2>5. Inspections</h2>
    <p>We perform a bumper-to-bumper inspection on every vehicle before bidding, including mechanical, electrical, and diagnostic code scanning. However, auction vehicles are sold in their current condition and we cannot guarantee that all potential issues will be identified during inspection.</p>

    <h2>6. Auction Warranty</h2>
    <p>Green Light vehicles purchased at auction come with a 7–14 day auction warranty. If significant undisclosed issues are discovered during this period, we can pursue a return or price negotiation with the auction house on your behalf.</p>

    <h2>7. Payment</h2>
    <p>We accept payment via Zelle (preferred) and PayPal. Vehicle payment details and methods are discussed and arranged during the paperwork stage of the process.</p>

    <h2>8. No Financing</h2>
    <p>We do not offer direct financing. Customers are welcome to arrange their own financing through their bank, credit union, or other lending institution.</p>

    <h2>9. Delivery & Shipping</h2>
    <p>Local pickup is available at no extra cost. Nationwide shipping can be arranged, with shipping costs paid by the customer. Delivery timelines may vary based on carrier availability and distance.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Goke Motor Services acts as a vehicle sourcing and purchasing service. We are not responsible for mechanical failures, defects, or issues that arise after the auction warranty period has expired. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages related to the vehicle or our service.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about these terms, please contact us at:</p>
